# Code conventions
## Namespaces
The universal namespace prefix is Moodle. For every class the namespace should respect this structure:
```
Moodle.feature-family.feature.service
```
- **feature-family** is related to how the feature was designed.
- **feature** is the feature associated to your service.
- **service** is the service associated to your class.
